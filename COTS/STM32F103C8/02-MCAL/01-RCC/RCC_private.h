 * 
 * This module provides functions for configuring the system clock source and frequency, as well as enabling and disabling
 * peripheral clocks. It also includes functions for resetting peripherals and reading the current clock frequency. It is
 * designed to be used with ARM Cortex-M processors, and may not be compatible with other architectures.
 *
 * @note This module is intended for use with the STM32F10x microcontroller series, but may be adapted for use with
 * other compatible processors.
